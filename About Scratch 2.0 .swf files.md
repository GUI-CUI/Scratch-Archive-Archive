Despite the fact that I previously said I would not add Scratch 2.0 to this repository, here I am! The two reasons for this is that (1) I have found a Beta!, and (2) I have discovered that Scratch no longer provides a Scratch 2.0 download link for Linux :( However, I have dug up such a version. To use the Beta version, use an online Flash Player with an old Chrome version that supports it (an old Chrome version can be found here: https://www.slimjet.com/chrome/google-chrome-old-version.php (Warning: Once you scroll down, click, download, and install the old Chrome version you want. /!\ Do not download the SlimJet browser they recommend! It might be full of viruses!!!)) and an online Flash Player to use with it here: http://flashplayer.fullstacks.net/. To use the online version of Scratch 2.0, use the same old Chrome browser and Flash Player URL linked before. To use Scratch 2.0 for Linux, install Adobe AIR and run the other file. Note: the Linux version of Scratch 2.0 is for 32-bit systems only.
