## File Contribution

If you would like to contribute files, please:
1. Create a fork.
2. Message me at my [Scratch profile](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/retro_person/), and I will add all new files in your fork to my repository.  
OR  
Start a pull request in your fork.
3. Ta-da! Your files are now in my repository.

Note: I update this repository frequently, so make sure to stay up-to-date!

## Additionally...

* Sadly, I do not take donations yet. Look out in the future for that!
* Any bugs/glitches/other issues? Open a new issue in the "Issues" tab up top, or discuss it in the "Discussions" tab.
* Have any more Scratch mods/versions? Open a new issue or discuss it as well, or create a fork with the required files to run the mod or version (see above).
