Scratch GPIO 3 is basically a version of Scratch 1.4 purely designed for the Raspberry Pi. It is pretty much a .sh file and some extra .py files for
different handlers. But, believe it or not, this will work on any Linux machine, including a ChromeBook! First, download Scratch 1.4 for Linux by typing
`sudo apt-get install scratch`. Then, download the "Scratch GPIO 3" folder in this repository and put it in your main directory. Afterwards, go into your main directory and type `cd "Scratch GPIO 3" && ./scratchgpio3` to start Scratch GPIO 3.
