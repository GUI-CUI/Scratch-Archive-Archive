So, in Dream, if you go to the "Costumes" tab, you'll get an error. The same error occurs when you go into the "Images" tab in Dream 1.1 Beta. To fix this in both Dream and Dream 1.1 Beta, click "Debug" > "ReporterBlockMorph(CommandBlockMorph)>>uncoloredArgMorphFor:" > [right-click] > "proceed (p)", and it should work! In Dream 1.1 Beta, if you click the "Project" tab, you'll also get an error. This one is simpler: just click "Proceed" twice.
