Since you have come to this file, I'm assuming you want to know about .swf files. .swf files are files that use a Flash player. Since some of these Scratch mods are Flash-based, that is the reason they use the .swf file extension. Since Chrome is dropping support for Flash, you're going to need an old version of Chrome. Here are some download links:
