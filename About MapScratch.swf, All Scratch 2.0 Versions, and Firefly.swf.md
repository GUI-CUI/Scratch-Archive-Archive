So, you might see some files called MapScratch.swf, Scratch 2.0 xxxxx.swf, or Firefly.swf. However, these files CANNOT be played through the online .swf player! To use them, download and launch the Flash Player.exe file in this repository; then click File > Open... > Browse... > [select MapScratch.swf, Firefly.swf, or Scratch 2.0 xxxxx.swf] > Open > Ok > done! If you're a Linux user like me, use Wine. For more information about Wine, please see README.md.
