So, Firefly is a Scratch mod which has both a Scratch 2.0 version and a Scratch 1.4 version. To use the 2.0 version, launch Firefly.swf in the Flash Player content debugger (see "About MapScratch.swf, All Scratch 2.0 Versions, and Firefly.swf.md" for more information on that), and open the file in this repository called "static.sb". To launch the 1.4 version, just run Firefly.image in SqueakJS (see "README.md" for more information about that).
